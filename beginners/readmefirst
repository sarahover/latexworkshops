About these files & folder(s):

- "EarlierVersions" folder contains examples that are from non-current workshops
- .zip files are complete bundled LaTeX projects (see below for use)

The 2021 files include an "ex" extension for the example used in the lesson for students to work from, 
while the "full" includes extra information plus solutions. 2022 & 2023 are full walkthroughs of the document produced in the workshop (includes further notes and comments).

The "Getting Started" pdf includes tips and resources for learning LaTeX.


     To use the zip files:

With Overleaf - just upload directly (do not unzip) as a new project, start editing with the "main" file

With a Desktop distribution - unzip and open the "main" file for editing, keeping all files in the same location
