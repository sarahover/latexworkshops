About these files:

.zip files are bundled LaTeX projects. The 2021 files include an "ex" extension for the example used in the lesson for students to work from, 
while the "full" includes extra information plus solutions. 2022 is just a full walkthrough of the document produced in the workshop.

The "Getting Started" pdf includes tips and resources for learning LaTeX.


     To use the zip files:

With Overleaf - just upload directly (do not unzip) as a new project, start editing with the "main" file

With a Desktop distribution - unzip and open the "main" file for editing, keeping all files in the same location
