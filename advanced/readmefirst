About these files:

.zip files are bundled LaTeX projects


     To use the zip files:

With Overleaf - just upload directly (do not unzip) as a new project, start editing with the "main" file

With a Desktop distribution - unzip and open the "main" file for editing, keeping all files in the same location



About using citation managers with LaTeX:

 - EndNote - use "label" field to manually add citation keys (otherwise they have internal RN (reference numbers) assigned)
 - Mendeley Desktop - each reference has an extra comma after the last reference field in the BibTeX record, manually remove these as needed
   (what caused the error in the recording link below)
- Zotero - BetterBibTeX highly recommended to customize citation keys, does export without this fine
