# latexworkshops
Collection of LaTeX workshop materials from library instruction developed while at Virginia Tech (2022+) and the University of Maryland (2018-2021)

Folders contain specific files and handouts for those workshop topics:
- beginners: intro-level workshop in both basic and accelerated version
- references: citations and references workshop
- theses: larger projects, theses, dissertations, etc.

Zip files are used throughout for LaTeX examples to provide easy upload to Overleaf and to avoid 
confusion for beginners in what files they need.
